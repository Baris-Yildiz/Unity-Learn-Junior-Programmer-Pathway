# Unity Learn Junior Programmer Pathway
This repository contains my takes of the prototype projects, challenge projects
and other educational projects that were assigned throughout the Unity Learn 
Junior Programmer Pathway. The assets were provided by Unity and other artists, 
the code and game design (not the core game design, just some extra features) 
are my own implementations.

The projects are provided as Unity packages. In order to access them, open a Unity
project and import these packages.

The Project "Defend The World" was too big, so it was split into two parts.
